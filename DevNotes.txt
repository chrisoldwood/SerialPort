Development Structure
---------------------

The source folder structure is required by the solution & projects to be like
this:-

+-SerialPort
+-Lib
| +-Core
| +-WCL
+-Scripts

The following commands will create that structure by cloning the various
application and library repositories:-

> mkdir Win32
> git clone https://github.com/chrisoldwood/SerialPort.git Win32\SerialPort
> mkdir Win32\Lib
> git clone https://github.com/chrisoldwood/Core.git Win32\Lib\Core
> git clone https://github.com/chrisoldwood/WCL.git Win32\Lib\WCL
<optional>
> git clone https://github.com/chrisoldwood/Scripts.git Win32\Scripts

Command Line Builds
-------------------

Included in the scripts folder is one for building via the command line:-

> pushd Win32
> Scripts\SetVars vc90
> Scripts\Build debug SerialPort\SerialPort.sln

There is also one for upgrading to a later version of Visual C++:-

> Scripts\SetVars vc140
> Scripts\Upgrade SerialPort\SerialPort.sln
